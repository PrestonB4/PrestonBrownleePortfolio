    "# Optimal NBA Team Selection (CST-435)\n",

    "**Contributors:** Preston Brownlee, Chat-GPT Assistance\n",

    "**Streamlit App:** streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py  \n",

    "**Executive Summary.**  \n",
    "I implemented a deep Artificial Neural Network (MLP) in **NumPy** to classify “optimal” players in a 5-year NBA window using interpretable basketball features. The Streamlit app constructs three lineups: **Overall**, **Offense**, and **Defense** enforcing one player per position (PG/SG/SF/PF/C), and explains the selections with stat-based drivers. This notebook documents the approach, dataset, model, and findings, using screenshots exported from the app.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Goal.** From a 5-year window of NBA seasons, sample a **100-player** pool and select an **optimal team of 5**—one per position (PG, SG, SF, PF, C)—according to a definition of “optimal” that balances team roles and performance.\n",
